## üõ† Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Microsoft Fabric Access Token

## üîë Obtaining the Access Token

To use FabricCLI with Microsoft Fabric, you need a valid bearer token. Tokens are short-lived and need to be periodically updated.

### Steps to Obtain the Bearer Token:

1. Go to [Microsoft Power BI](https://app.powerbi.com/)
2. Log in with your Microsoft Fabric credentials.
3. Open the browser's developer tools by pressing `F12`.
4. In the developer tools, press `Ctrl + F` (or `Cmd + F` on Mac) to open the search bar.
5. Search for `powerBIAccessToken` among the network requests.
6. Copy the token value, then set it as an environment variable named `POWER_BI_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your terminal or IDE.

```bash
export POWER_BI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

### Be sure to update this token periodically, as it expires after a short time!
