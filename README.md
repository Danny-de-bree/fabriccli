To roll-out Fabric as a code we have developed a command line interface.

## Fabric API Client

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/articles/

## Authentication

Not all API endpoints are SPN supported. If an endpoint is not supported by SPN, you can use a short-lived token that you can copy from the browser.

Beware! If you set POWER_BI_ACCESS_TOKEN it will overwrite all other authentication methods.

### Using SPN for Authentication

To use SPN (Service Principal Name) for authentication, follow these steps:

1. **üîëLogin with SPN**:
    ```sh
    fabric login-spn --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET --tenant-id YOUR_TENANT_ID
    ```

### Using a service-account or Personal account

At this moment not all api calls are supported by SPN.
A workaround for this is the following:

1. Login with your azure account with az login.

    ```sh
    az login
    ```

    ```sh
    fabric login default
    ```
